Gotcha We're gonna get the water from your house (your house) No water in the water fountain No wood in the woodstock And you say old Molly Hare Whatcha doin' there? Nothing much to do when you're going nowhere Woohaw! Woohaw! Gotcha We're gonna get the water from your house (your house) Nothing feels like dying like the drying of my skin and lawn Why do we just sit here while they watch us wither til we're gone? I can't seem to feel it I can't seem to feel it I can't seem to feel I'll kneel I'll kneel I'll kneel the cold steel You will ride the whip You'll ride the crack No use in fighting back You'll sledge the hammer if there's no one else to take the flak I can't seem to feel it I can't seem to find it Your fist clenched my neck We're neck and neck and neck... No water in the water fountain No phone in the phone booth And you say old Molly Hare Whatcha doin' there Jump back, jump back Daddy shot a bear Woohaw! Woohaw! Gotcha We're gonna get the water from your house (your house) I saved up all my pennies and I gave them to this special guy When he had enough of them he bought himself a cherry pie He gave me a dollar A blood-soaked dollar I cannot get the spot out but It's okay it still works in the store Greasy man come and dig my well Life without your water is a burning hell Serve me up with your home-grown rice Anything make me shit nice Se pou zanmi mwen, se pou zanmi mwen And the two-pound chicken tastes better with friends A two-pound chicken tastes better with two And I know where to find you so Listen to the words I said Let it sink into your head A vertigo round-and-round-and-round Now I'm in your bed How did I get ahead? Whoop! Thread your fingers through my hair Fingers through my hair Give me a dress Give me a press I give a thing a caress Would-ja, would-ja, would-ja Listen to the words I say! Sound like a floral bouquet A lyrical round-and-roundandroundandround Okay Take a picture it'll last all day, hey Your fingers through my hair Do it 'til you disappear Gimme your head Gimme your head Off with his head! Hey hey hey hey hey No water in the water fountain Floral bouquet A lyrical round-and-roundandroundandround No side on the sidewalk Take a picture it'll last all day, hey And you say old Molly Hare, Hare Nothing much to do when you're going nowhere Woohaw! Woohaw! We're gonna get the water from your house, your house We're gonna get the water from your house, your house We're gonna get the water from your house, your house We're gonna get the water from your house, your house"
